"""
Web Search Module for the Local Multimodal LLM Agent.

This module simulates the functionality of performing a web search based on a query.
It's designed to be used by the agent when information is likely to be found on
the public internet, especially for current events or topics not covered by
local files or specialized knowledge bases.

Currently, this is a placeholder implementation and does not make actual external
HTTP requests. It returns mock search results for specific queries.

    """
    Simulates performing a web search based on a query string.

    This function is the entry point for the web search module. It expects an
    `input_data` dictionary containing a 'query' key with the search string.

    The current simulation returns predefined mock search results (including title,
    link, and snippet) if specific keywords like "ollama python agent" or "weather"
    are found in the query. It does not interact with any real search engines.

    Args:
        input_data (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing the input for the tool.
            Expected keys:
            - "query" (str): The search term or question to search on the web.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the results of the simulated search.
            Includes:
            - "status" (str): A message indicating the outcome of the operation.
            - "query_received" (str): The original query string received.
            - "search_results" (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries, where each
              dictionary represents a mock search result with "title", "link", and
              "snippet" keys.
            - "summary" (str): A human-readable summary of the search operation.
            - "error" (str, optional): An error message if the query is missing.
