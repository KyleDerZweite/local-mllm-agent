"""
File Search Module for the Local Multimodal LLM Agent.

This module simulates the functionality of searching for files on a local filesystem
based on a query. It's intended to be used by the agent when a user's prompt
suggests a need to find or check local documents.

Currently, this is a placeholder implementation and does not perform actual
filesystem operations. It returns mock results based on keywords in the query.

def run(input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Simulates searching for files based on a query and optional directory.

    This function is the entry point for the file search module. It takes an
    `input_data` dictionary which should contain a 'query' string. An optional
    'directory' can also be provided.

    The current simulation returns predefined mock file paths if specific keywords
    like "report" or "data" are found in the query. It does not interact with
    the actual filesystem.

    Args:
        input_data (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing the input for the tool.
            Expected keys:
            - "query" (str): The search term or keywords to look for.
            - "directory" (str, optional): The specific directory to simulate searching in.
              If not provided, defaults to './documents_test'.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the results of the simulated search.
            Includes:
            - "status" (str): A message indicating the outcome of the operation.
            - "query_received" (str): The original query string received.
            - "directory_searched" (str): The directory that was targeted for the search.
            - "files_found" (List[str]): A list of (mock) file paths that match the query.
            - "summary" (str): A human-readable summary of the search results.
            - "error" (str, optional): An error message if the query is missing.
